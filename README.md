This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe for two players. It features a text-based user interface and provides clear instructions on how to play the game.

## How to Play
1. Run the program and enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2 when prompted.
2. The game board will be displayed, and you'll take turns to make moves by entering numbers from 1 to 9, representing the positions on the board.
3. Player 1 starts as "X", and Player 2 is "O".
4. The game continues until a player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol, or if all the positions on the board are filled, resulting in a draw.
